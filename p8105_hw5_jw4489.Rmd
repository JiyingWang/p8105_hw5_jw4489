## Problem 1

##### Describe the raw data.

```{r}
raw_df1 = read.csv("hw5data/homicide-data.csv")

view(raw_df1)
```

According to the raw data, we can see that it has `r nrow(raw_df1)` observations, and `r ncol(raw_df1)` variables in total.

```{r}
df1 = raw_df1 |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "))

view(df1)
```

```{r}
df1_summarized = df1 |>
  group_by(city_state) |>
  summarize(total_homicides = n(),
             unsolved_homicides = sum(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest")))

df1_summarized
```

##### Estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolve.

```{r}
baltimore_prop_test = 
  prop.test(df1_summarized |>
            filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") |>
            pull(unsolved_homicides),
            df1_summarized |>
            filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") |>
            pull(total_homicides))

baltimore_tidy = baltimore_prop_test |>
  broom::tidy()

baltimore_tidy
```

```{r}
estimate = baltimore_tidy |>
  pull(estimate)
conf_low = baltimore_tidy |>
  pull(conf.low)
conf_high = baltimore_tidy |>
  pull(conf.high)
```

Hence the estimated proportion is `r estimate`, and the confidence interval is (`r conf_low`, `r conf_high`).
