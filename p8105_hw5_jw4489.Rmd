## Problem 1

##### Describe the raw data.

```{r}
raw_df1 = read.csv("hw5data/homicide-data.csv")

view(raw_df1)
```

According to the raw data, we can see that it has `r nrow(raw_df1)` observations, and `r ncol(raw_df1)` variables in total.

```{r}
df1 = raw_df1 |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "))

view(df1)
```

```{r}
df1_summarized = df1 |>
  group_by(city_state) |>
  summarize(total_homocides = n(),
             unsolved_homicides = sum(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest")))

df1_summarized
```
